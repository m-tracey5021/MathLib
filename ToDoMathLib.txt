ToDo Short-term:

	- reconfigure class structure for trees, so that eqTree has its own node type with relevant functions
		- subclass treeElement to acheive this
	- write function to convert to fraction from decimal, integer etc
	- sort out comparison functions for the set class
	

Goals Long-term:

	
	
	
Done:

	- figure out how to restrict possible types for Set class
	- write unit tests for fraction arithmetic
